We’re all seen the classic “LOVE / HATE” tattoos where each letter is
tattooed onto a different knuckle. In 2010 I saw a tweet from Twitter
comedian and voiceover performer [Scott Fletcher](https://twitter.com/MrScottFletcher)
joking about how awesome a random knuckle tattoo generator would be.

It’s a simple idea: pick two random four letter words, and tattoo them onto
a pair of fists. Hilarity is bound to ensue, so I built one. Now you can
[generate a random knuckle tattoo](https://www.benjaminasmith.com/toys/fistbump)
of your very own.

Built in a couple of lazy hours. Vanilla HTML/JS/CSS with no dependencies on, 
well, anything. Clean and simple. 

Pull requests welcome.
